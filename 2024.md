#### GOALS
What are my main goals for this year? What follows is my attempt to answer that:  
1. Get a new job.
    * My good friend's dad got me in contact with a guy who needs a Python developer. We had a meetup a couple of weeks ago, and I reached out to him by email afterward to confirm I am interested in joining the project. I've yet to hear back, but I'm optimistic that this could become my first legitimate development job! It would be part-time, so I'd have to continue with my current job alongside it.
2. Pursue a Masters Degree from CU Boulder
    * Since the opportunity mentioned above came my way, I'm thinking this goal needs to be pushed to springtime or later. I'm still preparing for it by taking preliminary classes on Coursera, but I don't want to try to start the degree program this January while also starting the part-time job! Nevertheless, this goal still remains a priority!
3. Hone my interests / Build something robust
    * These two goals go hand in hand. I don't want to start any old project but something that will further my goals. I watched a video that inspired me to explore frontend frameworks like *React*. [This video](https://youtu.be/ro4oGwMb-T4?si=5SgKq55R36pFydau), "The end of the 'Self-Taught Programmer'," outlines important skills to learn if one wants to stand up an application from end-to-end while developing on demand skills. He bases his recommendations on the desired qualifications written in a job posting. Here they are:
      * React development, Javascript, Redux, RESTful APIs, authorization mechanisms, continuous integration and delivery technologies, agile scrum development methodology.
    * I'm still interested in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning - I'd really like to continue with the fastai program, but I think it needs to be on hold for the moment while I see how the potential job opportunity pans out.
    * I really want to get back into writing stuff in the C language again, and that probably entails embedded systems, IoT, etc. If I explore that route, I want to do it right, with laser focus. I want to start on a project straight away and use it as a platform to become familiar with all the skills and technologies I need.
    * I'd like to get a more intuitive understanding of how the internet works. This is partly what makes me interested in IoT since it marries two arenas I'm interested in: embedded systems and the internet in general. 
    * Finally, my main focus is to get more proficient in the most marketable skills, and that probably means Python. I already am comfortable writing in Python, but I'd like to take my skills to the next level. Hopefuly this part-time job opportunity will be the vehicle for that goal!
