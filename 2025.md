#### Where Things Stand
Already, this year has progressed very differently from last year, for which I had outlined three goals: get a new job, start the CU Boulder Masters program, and build important side projects. 

I didn’t get a new job, but I learned how to write a ton of cover letters and receive a ton of automated rejection emails. Confidently, I am far closer to getting a new job than I was six months ago. I didn’t start a Masters degree; instead, I started a Bachelors with WGU, and I’m very happy with that decision. I had a lot of false starts with my side projects. Looking back on my notes, I see several times when I intended to start a lengthy project only to pivot a couple weeks later. I think starting school was the culprit. My Hasse Diagram Generator was a great little project that I worked on from start to finish, learning the nuances of Rust in the process. I’m proud of that one.

This year is different because my goals are much more ironclad. They are as follows: get a new job or internship, aim to finish my CS program, and build projects that directly improve my way of living. I have clear prospects in all three goals: I’ve got a second interview coming up, I’m making swift progress in my degree, and this last month, I’ve been hacking away at projects like a madman.

I’ve been keeping myself so busy with CS coursework, side projects, and worky work that I didn’t find time to update this log — elsewhere, I’ve called attention to the irony of writing little when there’s much to say and writing much when there’s little to say. Well, there has been much to say, and I’ve finally gotten around to it.

#### Media and SFTP Servers
A confluence of many events finally produced in me a deep appreciation for open source, internet privacy, and keeping things practical in life. I decided it was time to fully ditch streaming music and rebuild a collection of music that I _own_, fully DRM-free. I dusted off the old desktop machine with Ubuntu installed and I began configuring a server with plex. I used a tutorial video, [Incredible Budget Home Server!](https://youtu.be/72D3MvPk3Xs?si=MG4GxgGCANfHHZGE), to help with the process. All told, my first setup involved an SMB connection with samba to load files onto the server from another machine and a plex server exposed to the internet via port forwarding.

From there, I wanted to give myself access to my files remotely, creating an FTP server that could replace my cloud storage providers. I ditched the SMB connection since I found it is too insecure to use over the internet. Instead, I simply used SSH with SFTP clients like FileZilla on Windows and Linux, and FE File Explorer on iOS.

SSH is not without security risks, so to harden my server, I changed the default SSH port away from 22, replaced password access with RSA key access, and configured an obscure DDNS domain on my router both to make sure that remote connection isn’t lost on account of DHCP, and to add just a little extra security.

I’m very pleased with my final setup, which includes a fully functioning media server and SFTP server that works just as well as cloud services. Awesome!
