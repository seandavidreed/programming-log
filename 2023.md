#### Code - *Book*
Read more of chapter 17, “Automation”. I’m learning about how an array of “instructions” such as Load, Add, Store, and Halt can be applied to a data array in order to perform arithmetical operations. I can see where this is going: the book is barely scratching the surface of assembly code and showing how it interacts with data.

#### Linux Pocket Guide
Learned how to examine the permissions of a given file or directory: `ls -l myfile` the resulting line will look something like this `-rwxrwxrwx username username timestamp` the 10-char string at the beginning tells what type of list element it is with the first char and then the remaining nine chars show what permissions three different groups have. In the example above, all groups can read, write, and execute.

#### Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms
I can see that this course would be very instructive, and I foresee that I will use it in the future, but I think it might be the wrong choice for the nonce. I realized I’d like to explore C++ more deeply before taking a course solely dedicated to data structures and algos.

#### C++20 Masterclass - *Udemy*
I’m excited about this course. I hope I can complete it in about 3.5 months, but we’ll see! I watched sections 1 through 4. The instructor advised us to watch the environment setup videos for every OS, even if we weren’t using a particular one. This way, we could learn how it is done on each. Ultimately, I got VSCode set up on my Linux machine. We used the terminal to check whether GCC and Clang were installed, then we installed them if they weren’t already installed, then we edited the tasks.json file in our project folder to allow us to easily build with either compiler, and finally we told VSCode to use the C++20 standard in a file called c_cpp_properties.json, which was created after accessing the command palette and entering C/C++:Edit Configurations (UI).

### 1/3/2023
#### Code - *Book*
Currently reading the section of Chapter 17 on making the adding machine more flexible. Now, we include 2 bytes with every instruction opcode to tell the CPU where to perform the instruction. This is more flexible than using two contiguous arrays (instruction array and data array) that must be always synchronized, instruction memory address to data memory address. I find all this very fascinating and I'm eager to make it all more intuitive as I continue studying!

#### C++20 Masterclass
Finished watching sections five and six. I'm glad I did because they helped solidify the VSCode setup process. I like the idea of having a template project folder that I can simply `cp template_project` and `mv template_project project_name`. I am eager to get fully underway with this course, but I'm trying to make sure I don't overwork myself. Slow and steady wins the race, and I'm racing myself.

#### Bare Metal C
I went through the earlier part of Chapter 3 and refreshed myself; key terms are HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and GPIO (General Purpose Input Output). Since I had already written the demo program last time, I simply reviewed it to make sure I understood every part of it. I’m pleased that this book goes so in depth on the build process, compiling and linking. It’s possible that I will breeze through some parts of this book since it is geared toward beginner C programmers, but I know there will be many new concepts scattered throughout.

### 1/4/2023
#### C++20 Masterclass
I worked through all the videos in Section 8. Much of it was review for me, but I still sensed the value in it. Also, it helped to increase playback speed where I already completely understood what was being taught. My biggest takeway was the difference between Core Features, Standard Library and STL (Standard Template Library). The instructor did not go in depth, but I know these categorical distinctions will be useful later on. The demonstration of the `getline()` function was also useful. This is how we used it:  
`std::string name;  
getline(std::cin, name);`

### 1/5/2022
#### C++20 Masterclass
Watched and worked through section 9 videos 39 and 40. Nearly all of this material is review, but once again, I just increase playback speed and skim through them. Occasionally, some simple new concepts have emerged, which is the main reason I don't want to skip anything.  

Yes! Video 41 presented some new material and it all checks out with stackoverflow. The main takeaway from this video was three types of initialization: braced, functional, and assignment. Braced initialization is the preferred method since it does not allow the data to be altered or truncated if the variable is mishandled. [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18222926/what-are-the-advantages-of-list-initialization-using-curly-braces) on stackoverflow.com explains the concept further - they call it list initialization.  
I also watched video 42 and it was also helpful. This is going to be a great course.

#### Thoughts
I'm chipping away at this C++ course and really enjoying it! However, I've been feeling discouraged since I'm not working on any projects and I've been unsure of what I should be working on. Today I decided to do some research and find out what interests me. First, I looked at Socket Programming, but I think I found that it is merely a component of the larger topic of web programming, a field that I've thought about exploring more. The trouble is that web programming doesn't seem to excite me very much (of course that could change as my experience grows).  

After more browsing, I found the topic that sparked immediate interest IoT (Internet of Things). It includes all the things I think I like: embedded systems, working with C/C++, low-level programming, understanding how data is transmitted over networks via protocols, etc. I might look back at this and chuckle at my obvious inexperience. Anyhow, I need to find what I'm interested in and lean that direction. I need to not set up artificial barriers for myself!

#### C++20 Masterclass
I completed the video 43, fractional numbers. Then, I wrote a practice program, implementing a pythagorean theorem function using some of the principles (braced initialization, setprecision, default arguments) I've learned.  
Video 44, on boolean values, gave me the idea to store multiple boolean values in 1 byte. I wrote a program to do just that.  

I finished the rest of Section 8. I found the auto keyword the most significant: it allows us to use C++ in a more-or-less dynamically-typed fashion. I have yet to see where this keyword is most useful, but I'm sure I will in the coming lectures.    

#### Bare Metal C
I finished chapter 4. The main takeaways were from exploring the files created by the IDE at the creation of the project and from using GDB, the debugger. This chapter helped me appreciate just how much goes on under the hood, all the preliminary steps and initializations that must occur just so I can write my tiny LED-blinking program. HAL\_init() caught my attention the most since it has a catalog of hardware architectures from which it initializes the hardware with the appropriate data. If you can’t tell, I don’t fully understand it yet!

### 1/9/2023
#### Research
I'm exploring potential specializations in technology, and IoT and TinyML currently stand out the most. At the moment, I can't decide between the two!  

I went on LinkedIn to add my certificate from the C Programming Udemy class, create a profile summary that explains what my current job is and how I'm preparing for the future by studying Computer Science, and update my CS50x certification with the verified certificate, which I received a few days ago!

#### C++20 Masterclass
Completed lectures 49 through 51. This stuff was pretty basic! At the end of the lecture on Precedence and Associativity, the instructor explained that a programmer should not rely on the precedence table too much. That is to say, put parentheses in your expressions to make your intentions explicit. This will increase readability and decrease the potential of mishandling data.

#### Bare Metal C
Began working in chapter 4. The first part of the chapter is mainly about data types, so it is just review. Later in the chapter, I see that we’ll be getting to some content that should fill in some knowledge gaps for me.

### 1/10/2023
#### C++20 Masterclass
Sections 52 - 55. Topics covered: Increment Operators, postfix and prefix; Compound Assignment Operators (+=, -=, \*=, /=, %=); Relational Operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=); Logical Operators (&&, ||, !). Once again, this is pretty much all review. I’m glad to go over it, but I’d really like to get into the new stuff more.

#### C++20 Masterclass
Sections 56 - . Video 56 was quite long, but very useful. It covered output formatting with demonstrations of several functions and manipulators that can be applied to std::cout to alter how the data is displayed in the console.

57 was on the numeric\_limits class, which is found in the <limits> library. Once again, I found this very useful: it allows us to print out the range of storable values for a given data type. For instance, using `std::numeric_limits\<unsigned int\>::min()` and `std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max()`, we are able to see that the unsigned int data type indeed goes from 0 to over 4 billion.

The weird integral types lecture explained that the int data type is the smallest type with which we can perform arithmetical operations. This is due to the design of the processor. If we take two chars or two shorts and add them, the result will be automatically cast as an int; in order to do this, the compiler has to convert each variable to int beforehand.

With that, I've completed section 9! That's all for today with this course. 

#### Bare Metal C
I read a little more of chapter 4, and it was mostly review again. This is becoming a bit of a trend with my classes. Perhaps I need to be less of a completionist and know when to skim. I’m fine with being a completionist with the C++20 Masterclass, but with this book, I ought to start skimming ahead to content that is new.

The section Standard Integers in chapter 4 was actually very enlightening. The C standard only defines the integral types relative to each other (short is smaller than int is smaller than long). However, on some system, int is 2 bytes, and on others, it's 4 bytes (more common). To deal with this unpredictability, fixed-width data types were added with the stdint.h library (int32\_t). These guarantee a specific width (conditional compilation). However, we can still run into something called argument promotion, which is where a data type like int8\_t is promoted to int32\_t to accomodate a value which cannot be stored in the smaller width. In embedded programming, we don't want data types being manipulated under the hood. We want total control of their width, so that our program runs exactly as intended. Thus, it's better that the value overflow than get promoted.

I definitely spoke too soon with yesterdays first entry for this book. I'm learning some awesome things now. Chapter 4, starting from Shorthand Operators, started to challenge me: it seems to explain that increment and decrement operators should only be used on their own lines of code, not like this `while (arr[++i]);`. This seems to be perfectly legal C; I'll have to investigate further. Then, we got into Memory-Mapped I/O Registers Using Bit Operations. Here the book introduced us to bitwise operators. I copied down the program on pages 73-74, and It found it probably the most elucidating part of the chapter. Finally, I answered all the questions at the end of the chapter. For question 2b, I found that I needed to clear any values that might be present in the parity bits before reassigning them to a different value:  

```
// clear Parity  
ledRegister &= ~Parity; // Parity is 0b00001100  
// set Parity to 2  
ledRegister |= 0b00001000;  
```

### 1/13/2023
#### C++20 Masterclass
Lecture 62 on Literals. I thought I knew exactly what literals were beforehand, but this lecture gave a more nuanced understanding: at the moment, I would describe a literal as any value that is stored in the program binaries after compilation. In other words, if I have a program that takes input from the user,  

```
int not_a_literal;
std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
std::cin >> not_a_literal;

std::cout << "You entered " << not_a_literal << std::endl;
```

then I could use a non-literal (not\_a\_literal). This, `int literal;`, must be a literal. QUESTION: if a variable is uninitialized, does that make it a non-literal? I think the answer is yes.

#### Bare Metal C
Today was a light day, but I did manage to get a little study in. I read quickly through the first 6 pages of chapter 5 since it was entirely review. It was all about loop and conditional statements. I stopped just before the section entitled "Using the Button"; I'm fairly certain this section will provide me with new material to digest.

#### Miscellaneous
I realized I don't have a full understanding of the semiconductor, which is a key component of the modern computer (if not THE key component). I pulled up a tab, [What is a Semiconductor](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/semiconductor), and did a cursory read through. I fully intend to revisit this topic soon.

### 1/15/2023
#### Bare Metal C
Completed chapter five today, though I've yet to solve all the problems at the end. Here are the main takeaways from Chapter Five starting from the section entitled "Using the Button":

- We were shown three types of input circuitry: pullup, pulldown, and floating. These all have to do with how current is directed before closing the circuit and how it is redirected after closing it.
- When analyzing the code in "The Break Statement" section, I noticed the static keyword and I wanted to refresh myself on its purpose. I found an [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/) on GeeksForGeeks that explains static allocation very well. From there I found another [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/) on the memory layout of C programs. I found the following image very helpful:

![the memory layout of a C program](/images/memoryLayoutC.jpg "Memory layout of a C Program")

BSS, the block of memory where static variables are stored, stands for "Block Starting Symbol". The static keyword causes a variable to be stored in the .bss segment of memory; furthermore, it can be used to make a variable global even if it is declared within some local scope.

It took me far too long to solve chapter 5 problem 1; it's because I was trying to minimize the number of variables and use only two for loops, printing the product of their iterator variables. I completed the program, but I needed to use one initial for loop to set the column headers (X  0  1  2  3  ...).

I solved problem 2 much quicker and had a lot more fun! I enjoy anything that involves bitwise operations; it feels sneaky. For this problem, I had to write a program that could count the number of bits set to 1 in a 32-bit unsigned integer. I did it by running a for loop 32 times while ANDing the number against a 32-bit test value (0x80000000), only the most significant bit set to 1. If the result of the AND is equal to the test value itself, then a count variable is incremented. This is how I counted the number of bits.

I solved problem 3 this evening. I'm proud of my solution: I was able to make my program more user-friendly by using familiar musical jargon. All the user has to do is specify the TimeSignature and Tempo and then populate the uint8\_t array with the beats on which they want the light to flash.
