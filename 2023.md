#### Code - *Book*
Read more of chapter 17, “Automation”. I’m learning about how an array of “instructions” such as Load, Add, Store, and Halt can be applied to a data array in order to perform arithmetical operations. I can see where this is going: the book is barely scratching the surface of assembly code and showing how it interacts with data.

#### Linux Pocket Guide
Learned how to examine the permissions of a given file or directory: `ls -l myfile` the resulting line will look something like this `-rwxrwxrwx username username timestamp` the 10-char string at the beginning tells what type of list element it is with the first char and then the remaining nine chars show what permissions three different groups have. In the example above, all groups can read, write, and execute.

#### Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms
I can see that this course would be very instructive, and I foresee that I will use it in the future, but I think it might be the wrong choice for the nonce. I realized I’d like to explore C++ more deeply before taking a course solely dedicated to data structures and algos.

#### C++20 Masterclass - *Udemy*
I’m excited about this course. I hope I can complete it in about 3.5 months, but we’ll see! I watched sections 1 through 4. The instructor advised us to watch the environment setup videos for every OS, even if we weren’t using a particular one. This way, we could learn how it is done on each. Ultimately, I got VSCode set up on my Linux machine. We used the terminal to check whether GCC and Clang were installed, then we installed them if they weren’t already installed, then we edited the tasks.json file in our project folder to allow us to easily build with either compiler, and finally we told VSCode to use the C++20 standard in a file called c_cpp_properties.json, which was created after accessing the command palette and entering C/C++:Edit Configurations (UI).

#### Code - *Book*
Currently reading the section of Chapter 17 on making the adding machine more flexible. Now, we include 2 bytes with every instruction opcode to tell the CPU where to perform the instruction. This is more flexible than using two contiguous arrays (instruction array and data array) that must be always synchronized, instruction memory address to data memory address. I find all this very fascinating and I'm eager to make it all more intuitive as I continue studying!

#### C++20 Masterclass
Finished watching sections five and six. I'm glad I did because they helped solidify the VSCode setup process. I like the idea of having a template project folder that I can simply `cp template_project` and `mv template_project project_name`. I am eager to get fully underway with this course, but I'm trying to make sure I don't overwork myself. Slow and steady wins the race, and I'm racing myself.

#### Bare Metal C
I went through the earlier part of Chapter 3 and refreshed myself; key terms are HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and GPIO (General Purpose Input Output). Since I had already written the demo program last time, I simply reviewed it to make sure I understood every part of it. I’m pleased that this book goes so in depth on the build process, compiling and linking. It’s possible that I will breeze through some parts of this book since it is geared toward beginner C programmers, but I know there will be many new concepts scattered throughout.

#### C++20 Masterclass
I worked through all the videos in Section 8. Much of it was review for me, but I still sensed the value in it. Also, it helped to increase playback speed where I already completely understood what was being taught. My biggest takeway was the difference between Core Features, Standard Library and STL (Standard Template Library). The instructor did not go in depth, but I know these categorical distinctions will be useful later on. The demonstration of the `getline()` function was also useful. This is how we used it:  
`std::string name;  
getline(std::cin, name);`

### 1/5/2022
#### C++20 Masterclass
Watched and worked through section 9 videos 39 and 40. Nearly all of this material is review, but once again, I just increase playback speed and skim through them. Occasionally, some simple new concepts have emerged, which is the main reason I don't want to skip anything.  

Yes! Video 41 presented some new material and it all checks out with stackoverflow. The main takeaway from this video was three types of initialization: braced, functional, and assignment. Braced initialization is the preferred method since it does not allow the data to be altered or truncated if the variable is mishandled. [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18222926/what-are-the-advantages-of-list-initialization-using-curly-braces) on stackoverflow.com explains the concept further - they call it list initialization.  
I also watched video 42 and it was also helpful. This is going to be a great course.

#### Thoughts
I'm chipping away at this C++ course and really enjoying it! However, I've been feeling discouraged since I'm not working on any projects and I've been unsure of what I should be working on. Today I decided to do some research and find out what interests me. First, I looked at Socket Programming, but I think I found that it is merely a component of the larger topic of web programming, a field that I've thought about exploring more. The trouble is that web programming doesn't seem to excite me very much (of course that could change as my experience grows).  

After more browsing, I found the topic that sparked immediate interest IoT (Internet of Things). It includes all the things I think I like: embedded systems, working with C/C++, low-level programming, understanding how data is transmitted over networks via protocols, etc. I might look back at this and chuckle at my obvious inexperience. Anyhow, I need to find what I'm interested in and lean that direction. I need to not set up artificial barriers for myself!

#### C++20 Masterclass
I completed the video 43, fractional numbers. Then, I wrote a practice program, implementing a pythagorean theorem function using some of the principles (braced initialization, setprecision, default arguments) I've learned.  
Video 44, on boolean values, gave me the idea to store multiple boolean values in 1 byte. I wrote a program to do just that.  

I finished the rest of Section 8. I found the auto keyword the most significant: it allows us to use C++ in a more-or-less dynamically-typed fashion. I have yet to see where this keyword is most useful, but I'm sure I will in the coming lectures.    

#### Bare Metal C
I finished chapter 4. The main takeaways were from exploring the files created by the IDE at the creation of the project and from using GDB, the debugger. This chapter helped me appreciate just how much goes on under the hood, all the preliminary steps and initializations that must occur just so I can write my tiny LED-blinking program. HAL\_init() caught my attention the most since it has a catalog of hardware architectures from which it initializes the hardware with the appropriate data. If you can’t tell, I don’t fully understand it yet!

### 1/9/2023
#### Research
I'm exploring potential specializations in technology, and IoT and TinyML currently stand out the most. At the moment, I can't decide between the two!  

I went on LinkedIn to add my certificate from the C Programming Udemy class, create a profile summary that explains what my current job is and how I'm preparing for the future by studying Computer Science, and update my CS50x certification with the verified certificate, which I received a few days ago!

#### C++20 Masterclass
Completed lectures 49 through 51. This stuff was pretty basic! At the end of the lecture on Precedence and Associativity, the instructor explained that a programmer should not rely on the precedence table too much. That is to say, put parentheses in your expressions to make your intentions explicit. This will increase readability and decrease the potential of mishandling data.

#### Bare Metal C
Began working in chapter 4. The first part of the chapter is mainly about data types, so it is just review. Later in the chapter, I see that we’ll be getting to some content that should fill in some knowledge gaps for me.
