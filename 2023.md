#### Code - *Book*
Read more of chapter 17, “Automation”. I’m learning about how an array of “instructions” such as Load, Add, Store, and Halt can be applied to a data array in order to perform arithmetical operations. I can see where this is going: the book is barely scratching the surface of assembly code and showing how it interacts with data.

#### Linux Pocket Guide
Learned how to examine the permissions of a given file or directory: `ls -l myfile` the resulting line will look something like this `-rwxrwxrwx username username timestamp` the 10-char string at the beginning tells what type of list element it is with the first char and then the remaining nine chars show what permissions three different groups have. In the example above, all groups can read, write, and execute.

#### Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms
I can see that this course would be very instructive, and I foresee that I will use it in the future, but I think it might be the wrong choice for the nonce. I realized I’d like to explore C++ more deeply before taking a course solely dedicated to data structures and algos.

#### C++20 Masterclass - *Udemy*
I’m excited about this course. I hope I can complete it in about 3.5 months, but we’ll see! I watched sections 1 through 4. The instructor advised us to watch the environment setup videos for every OS, even if we weren’t using a particular one. This way, we could learn how it is done on each. Ultimately, I got VSCode set up on my Linux machine. We used the terminal to check whether GCC and Clang were installed, then we installed them if they weren’t already installed, then we edited the tasks.json file in our project folder to allow us to easily build with either compiler, and finally we told VSCode to use the C++20 standard in a file called c_cpp_properties.json, which was created after accessing the command palette and entering C/C++:Edit Configurations (UI).
