#### Code - *Book*
Read more of chapter 17, “Automation”. I’m learning about how an array of “instructions” such as Load, Add, Store, and Halt can be applied to a data array in order to perform arithmetical operations. I can see where this is going: the book is barely scratching the surface of assembly code and showing how it interacts with data.

#### Linux Pocket Guide
Learned how to examine the permissions of a given file or directory: `ls -l myfile` the resulting line will look something like this `-rwxrwxrwx username username timestamp` the 10-char string at the beginning tells what type of list element it is with the first char and then the remaining nine chars show what permissions three different groups have. In the example above, all groups can read, write, and execute.

#### Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms
I can see that this course would be very instructive, and I foresee that I will use it in the future, but I think it might be the wrong choice for the nonce. I realized I’d like to explore C++ more deeply before taking a course solely dedicated to data structures and algos.

#### C++20 Masterclass - *Udemy*
I’m excited about this course. I hope I can complete it in about 3.5 months, but we’ll see! I watched sections 1 through 4. The instructor advised us to watch the environment setup videos for every OS, even if we weren’t using a particular one. This way, we could learn how it is done on each. Ultimately, I got VSCode set up on my Linux machine. We used the terminal to check whether GCC and Clang were installed, then we installed them if they weren’t already installed, then we edited the tasks.json file in our project folder to allow us to easily build with either compiler, and finally we told VSCode to use the C++20 standard in a file called c_cpp_properties.json, which was created after accessing the command palette and entering C/C++:Edit Configurations (UI).

#### Code - *Book*
Currently reading the section of Chapter 17 on making the adding machine more flexible. Now, we include 2 bytes with every instruction opcode to tell the CPU where to perform the instruction. This is more flexible than using two contiguous arrays (instruction array and data array) that must be always synchronized, instruction memory address to data memory address. I find all this very fascinating and I'm eager to make it all more intuitive as I continue studying!

#### C++20 Masterclass
Finished watching sections five and six. I'm glad I did because they helped solidify the VSCode setup process. I like the idea of having a template project folder that I can simply `cp template_project` and `mv template_project project_name`. I am eager to get fully underway with this course, but I'm trying to make sure I don't overwork myself. Slow and steady wins the race, and I'm racing myself.

#### Bare Metal C
I went through the earlier part of Chapter 3 and refreshed myself; key terms are HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and GPIO (General Purpose Input Output). Since I had already written the demo program last time, I simply reviewed it to make sure I understood every part of it. I’m pleased that this book goes so in depth on the build process, compiling and linking. It’s possible that I will breeze through some parts of this book since it is geared toward beginner C programmers, but I know there will be many new concepts scattered throughout.

#### C++20 Masterclass
I worked through all the videos in Section 8. Much of it was review for me, but I still sensed the value in it. Also, it helped to increase playback speed where I already completely understood what was being taught. My biggest takeway was the difference between Core Features, Standard Library and STL (Standard Template Library). The instructor did not go in depth, but I know these categorical distinctions will be useful later on. The demonstration of the `getline()` function was also useful. This is how we used it:  
`std::string name;
getline(std::cin, name);`
