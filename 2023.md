#### Code - *Book*
Read more of chapter 17, “Automation”. I’m learning about how an array of “instructions” such as Load, Add, Store, and Halt can be applied to a data array in order to perform arithmetical operations. I can see where this is going: the book is barely scratching the surface of assembly code and showing how it interacts with data.

#### Linux Pocket Guide
Learned how to examine the permissions of a given file or directory: `ls -l myfile` the resulting line will look something like this `-rwxrwxrwx username username timestamp` the 10-char string at the beginning tells what type of list element it is with the first char and then the remaining nine chars show what permissions three different groups have. In the example above, all groups can read, write, and execute.
