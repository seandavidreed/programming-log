# Daily Programming Log
Since I started programming, I've been logging my efforts
nearly every day, a practice that has kept me motivated
and focused. Now each entry I add to the log is its own reward.

This repo is meant to help me continue this habit with markdown
and the structure it offers, as with section linking and many
formatting options.
